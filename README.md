# Introduction

## What is Hamsikaa?

Hamsikaa is a humble effort to collate what has been revealed in our many texts and explained by many realised teachers. It is intended as a study aid for spiritual seekers, that provides texts in a normalised and searchable format. 

Everything in Hamsikaa is fully open sourced and always free for access both from the Hamsikaa website [https://hamsikaa.org](https://aagama.org) and from [this](https://github.com/pratyush1987/aparokshanubhuti.git) Git repository \(specific to Aparokshanubhuti\).

The word Hamsikaa \(‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ\) literally means swan. The original inspiration was the phrase muni-maansa-hamsikaa \(‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§ø-‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§∏-‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ\) in Lalitha Sahasranamam, which refers to Devi as the swan floating in the calm lake of the mind of a seer. Our infinite salutations to that Devi. üôè
