# Introduction

## Om, Shri Ganesaya Namah

## What is Hamsikaa?

Hamsikaa is a humble effort to collate what has been revealed in our many texts and explained by many realised teachers. It is intended as a study aid for spiritual seekers, that provides texts in a normalised and searchable format. 

Everything in Hamsikaa is fully open sourced and always free for access both from the Hamsikaa website [https://hamsikaa.org](https://aagama.org) and from [this](https://github.com/pratyush1987/aparokshanubhuti.git) Git repository \(specific to Aparokshanubhuti\).

The word Hamsikaa \(‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ\) literally means swan. The original inspiration was the phrase muni-maansa-hamsikaa \(‡§Æ‡•Å‡§®‡§ø-‡§Æ‡§æ‡§®‡§æ‡§∏-‡§π‡§Ç‡§∏‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ\) in Lalitha Sahasranamam, which refers to Devi as the swan floating in the calm lake of the mind of a seer. Our infinite salutations to that Devi. üôè

## About Aparokshanubhuti

### Meaning of the title

The word Aparokshanubhuti is split as Aparoksha + Anubhuti \(‡§Ö‡§™‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑ + ‡§Ö‡§®‡•Å‡§≠‡•Ç‡§§‡§ø\). Anubhuti means experience. What kinds of experience do we have? Firstly, we have experience directly mediated by sense-organs called Pratyaksha \(‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑\). All experience such as seeing, touching, tasting, etc. are Pratyaksha. The senses have their limitations and are also subject to deception. Then there is Paroksha \(‡§™‡§∞‡•ã‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑\) which is all experience beyond the range of our sense organs. These include the realm of belief, inference, and abstraction. Mathematics, the sciences, and conventional religion all belong to this class. Beyond both Pratyaksha and Paroksha, there is a third kind of experience which does not require sensory input or inference or belief. Instead, it not beyond the senses, instead it is the very ground of our sense organs. Such knowledge is the knowledge of the Self. Such experience is Aparoksha. This is a substantive and carefully chosen title of the text.

### Foundational texts

The three canonical texts of Advaita Vedanta are The Upanishads, The Bhagavad Gita, and The Bhramasutras. Beyond these, there are prakarna granthas which provided a structured pedagogy in introducing the ideas of Advaita Vedanta. Aparokshanubhuti is one such text. 

### Organisation

There are no chapters delineating the contents of the book. A very broad outline is as follows: 

* A discussion of the preparation required for receiving the knowledge of Vedanta
* The fundamental insights of Vedanta whereby the identification with body, mind, etc. are dropped
* An elaboration of the characteristics of a man of realization
* A technical discussion on the theory of karma
* The 15-step process through which a seeker progresses 
* Finally there is the proclamation of the oneness of cause and effect, of jivatma and paramatma
