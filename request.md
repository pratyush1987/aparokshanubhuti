## What is aagama?

Aagama is a humble effort to systematically collate what has been revealed in our many texts and explained by many realised teachers. It is intended as an aid for spiritual seekers by providing several texts in a normalised and searchable format. 

Everything in Aagama is fully open sourced and always free for access both from the aagama website https://aagama.org and from [this](https://github.com/pratyush1987/aparokshanubhuti.git) Git repository. 

The word aagama (‡§Ü‡§ó‡§Æ) literally means something handed down by tradition, and is often used to refer to the collective of our sacred texts.

## I found an error, how can I report it?

The content is input manually from different sources, and the likelihood of errors is high. We request readers to kindly report errors that they find. You can do so by sending an email to pratyushkpanda@gmail.com with the subject like 'Error in Aparokshanubhuti text'. üôè

## How can I contribute?

We will greatly appreciate any help from you. In particular, we solicit help to include the following:

* Transliteration of verses into other scripts
* Translation of the meaning into other languages
* Addition of commentaries by other teachers

## What skills are required to contribute?

We use Gitbook/Github to input and manage content for this site. The two major advantages of this are \(a\) allowing users to contribute text without any programming needed, and \(b\) enabling systematic review and merging of contributions made by various contributors. If you had like to volunteer, please send an email to pratyushkpanda@gmail.com with the subject 'Volunteering for Aagama'. üôè
