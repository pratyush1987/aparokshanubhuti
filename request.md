## What is Hamsikaa?

Hamsikaa is a humble effort to collate what has been revealed in our many texts and explained by many realised teachers. It is intended as a study aid for spiritual seekers that includes several texts in a normalised and searchable format. 

Everything in Hamsikaa is fully open sourced and always free for access both from the Hamsikaa website [https://hamsikaa.org](https://aagama.org) and from [this](https://github.com/pratyush1987/aparokshanubhuti.git) Git repository for this text.

The word Hamsikaa \(हंसिका\) literally means a swan. The original inspiration was the phrase muni-maansa-hamsikaa \(मुनि-मानास-हंसिका\) in Lalitha Sahasranamam, which refers to Devi as the swan floating in the calm lake of the mind of a seer. Infinite salutations to that Devi. 🙏

## I found an error, how can I report it?

The content is input manually from different sources, and the likelihood of errors is high. We request readers to kindly report errors that they find. You can do so by sending an email to pratyushkpanda@gmail.com with the subject like 'Error in Aparokshanubhuti text'. 🙏

## How can I contribute?

We will greatly appreciate any help from you. In particular, we solicit help to include the following:

* Transliteration of verses into other scripts
* Translation of the meaning into other languages
* Addition of commentaries by other teachers

## What skills are required to contribute?

We use Gitbook/Github to input and manage content for this site. The two major advantages of this are \(a\) allowing users to contribute text without any programming needed, and \(b\) enabling systematic review and merging of contributions made by various contributors. If you had like to volunteer, please send an email to pratyushkpanda@gmail.com with the subject 'Volunteering for Aagama'. 🙏
