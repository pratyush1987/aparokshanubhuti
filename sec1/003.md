## Commentaries

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Swami Vimuktananda" %}
The four preliminary qualifications ^1   \(the means to attainment of knowledge\), such as Vairagya \(dispassion\) and the like, are acquired by men  by propitiating Hari \(the Lord\), through austerities and the performance of duties pertaining to their social order and stage in life. 

^1 The four preliminary qualifications - These are वैराग्यं \(dispassion\), विवेक: \(discrimination\),  शमादिषट्सम्पत्तिः \(six treasures such as शम \(control of the mind\) and the like\), and मुमुक्षुत्वं \(yearning for liberation \(from the bondage of ignorance\) \).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Swami Chinmayananda" %}
Just as every student cannot go for higher mathematics classes or medicine or engineering, unless there is the right aptitude in the student for the same, so too to enter into the courtyard of Vedānta a certain predisposition of the mind is required. Those who do not have this predisposition will not be able to live successfully the values indicated and reap a profitable return out of it. This is not to say that those who lack this disposition will be denied the study but each seeker must check up within and should cultivate those qualifications that are lacking. Hence the teacher enumerates the necessary qualifications for an effective and fruitful study. 

The success of a seeker in spirituality depends on his ‘varṇa’, ‘āśrama’ austerities and devotion to Lord Hari. Varṇa is not the ‘caste’, which smacks of the tragic social vivisection. Varṇa of an individual is determined not by the caste of the parents but subtle ‘vāsanās’ if any. Varṇa basically means the different subtle shades of texture and colour as employed in the yogic sense. Varṇa refers to the mental temperaments of sattva, rajas and tamas. 

Ᾱśrama is the station one occupies in life. The four ‘āśramas are categorised as brahmacārī \(student\), gṛhastha \(house-holder\), vānaprastha \(retired one\) and sannyāsī \(renunciate\). The personality grouping, each one belongs to \(varṇa\) and the calling each one takes up \(āśrama\) is dependent on the inner emotional profile and his temperamental tendencies. 

Tapas is the concentration, control and regulation of the thought flow of the mind towards a noble goal. Tapas indicates the inner self-control while fulfilling our duties according to our status and social order. 

Thus living a life of complete self-control and doing our duties sincerely, efficiently, while at the same time meditating, contemplating and concentrating on the Lord, we propitiate Lord Hari. Here propitiation means Hari is always in me and by questioning the mind by the methods mentioned above, the existing vāsanās get exhausted and no new vāsanās are acquired. The mind then becomes contemplative. When the vāsanās are reduced, the agitations of the mind get reduced and Ᾱtman, the Consciousness starts shining more and more. The qualifications necessary for the seeker are discrimination \(viveka\), dispassion \(vairāgya\), discipline \(ṣaḍ sampatti\) and burning desire to liberate oneself from the thraldom of change \(mumukṣutvam\). When these qualifications are there in a person he is fit to study this textbook and contemplate upon.
