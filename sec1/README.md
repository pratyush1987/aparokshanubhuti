# Section 1: Verses 1-3

{% hint style="info" %}
The original textbook does _not_ have any sections. As an editorial choice, we have split the book into sections of sets of verses which together serve a related purpose. The start of each section also provides occasion for editorial comments on the content to follow.

The book begins with an invocation of the One reality. Adi Shankaracharya then systematically specifies the goal of the book and the pre-requisites for its study. The substantive title of the book is also mentioned in the second verse.
