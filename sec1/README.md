{% hint style="warning" %}
The original textbook does _not_ have any sections. As an editorial choice, we have split the book into sections of sets of verses which together serve a related purpose. The start of each section also provides occasion for editorial comments on the content to follow.

The book begins with an [invocation](001.md) of the One reality. Adi Shankaracharya then [specifies](002.md) the goal of the book and the qualifications for its study. The substantive title of the book \(aparokshanubhuti\) is explained in the [second verse](002.md).

This being an introductory \(prakarana\) text, in the six verses \(4 through 9\), Adi Shankaracharya defines individually the four qualifications \(sadhana chatustayam\) of a student, namely

* [vairagya](004.md)
* [viveka](005.md)
* shat-sampati
  * [sama and dama](007.md)
  * [uparati and titiksha](007.md)
  * [sraddha and samadhana](008.md)
* [mumukshutvam](009.md)

These means, Adi Shankaracharya [says](010.md) must be employed by the students for deep contemplation/enquiry \(vichara\), as it is [essential](011.md) for liberation. He then exemplifies the manner of enquiry in which setup the topics covered in the book.

* the [central questions](012.md) about self, world, and the Lord,
* the [negation](013.md) of the perceived self,
* the material and efficient [causes](014.md) of the world,
* the [underlying substance](015.md) behind the above, and
* the [real nature](016.md) of the Self
