## Commentaries

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Swami Vimuktananda" %}
The indifference with which one treats the excreta of a crow - such an indifference to all objects of enjoyment from the realm of Brahmā to this world \(in view of their perishable nature\), is verily called pure Vairagya^1. 

^1 Pure Vairagya - One may be indifferent to the enjoyments of this world only in expectation of better enjoyments in the next. This kind of indifference is tainted with desires which bar the door to Knowledge. But the indifference that results from a due deliberation on the evanescent nature of this world as well as the world to come, is alone pure, and productive of the highest good.

Vairāgya means detachment. How is this to be developed without leaving lust, passion and attachment to the world of objects around? Wherever I have attachment the mind is not available for contemplation. Therefore, in order to release the mind for contemplation, I must get released from my anxiety, hunger, thirst and attachment to the world of objects around. What exactly is detachment? Vairāgya is the complete and constant detachment to all sense objects in the world from Brahmā down to the world of a blade of grass. Just as we have complete detachment to the droppings of the crow so too vairāgya consists in developing complete detachment to the objects of the senses, whether heavenly or earthly. Vairāgya is an attitude of the mind. It is but natural for the mind and intellect to rebound whenever they think of the world of objects. Our minds may go to these objects unconsciously but the moment it contacts the world of objects it understands the hollowness and filthiness of such objects and so turns back from it. This mental attitude is called vairāgya. A mind soaked in vairāgya does not run to the field of sense objects. Such a mind commands the highest meditation.
