## Commentaries

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Swami Vimuktananda" %}
Ᾱtman^1 \(the seer\) in itself is alone permanent, the seen^2 is opposed to it \(i.e., transient\) - such a settled conviction is truly known as discrimination.

^1 Ᾱtman - In this ever-changing world there is one changeless being as witness of these changes. This permanent ever-seeing being is Ᾱtman.

^2 The seen - This comprises everything other than Ᾱtman, such as objects of the senses, the senses, the mind and the Buddhi.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Swami Chinmayananda" %}
The Ᾱtman, by Its nature, is Consciousness. It was in the past, is in the present and will be in the future in the same nature of illumination. All the experiences of the people who died in the past, the experience of all the living beings that are present and all the experiences of those that are to come in the future are all illumined by the same Consciousness. This Consciousness is the eternal illuminator. By Its nature It is eternal pure Consciousness. Indeed Ᾱtman is eternally permanent but the objects of the world are perceived by the awareness through the mind and intellect, and they are all impermanent. The awareness is eternal and changeless, but the objects of awareness are the body, the mind and the intellect - these are the perceived objects \(Dṛśyaṁ - the seen\). These are opposed to the nature of the eternal Ᾱtman. They are ever finite. 

Ᾱtman, the Self, is infinite and the objects of the world are finite, everchanging and decaying. One who has this great conviction that the Ᾱtman, the Self, is eternally permanent because of the experience born out of contemplation and meditation, is said to have discrimination. That individual is said to have discrimination \(viveka\) who knows fully well that the perceived world of objects are ever changing and that the Awareness that illumines them all is eternal. This discrimination to know that the Self in me is eternal, permanent and changeless, while the world of objects, emotions and thoughts are ever changing, is called discrimination. i.e. ‘Viveka’.
