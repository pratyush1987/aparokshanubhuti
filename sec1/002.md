{% tab title="Swami Vimuktananda" %}
Herein is expounded \(the means of attaining to\) Aparokshanubhuti$$^1$$ \(Self-realisation\) for the acquisition of final liberation. Only the pure in heart should constantly and with all effort meditate upon the truth herein taught.

$$^1$$_Aparokshanubhuti_ -- It is the direct cognition of the Atman which is always present in all thought.  
Everybody has some knowledge of this Atman or Self, for, to deny the Self is to deny one's own existence. But at first its real nature is not known. Later on, when the mind becomes purer through Upasana and Tapas, the veil of ignorance is gradually withdrawn and the Self begins to reveal its real nature. A higher knowledge follows at an advaned stage, when the knowledge of the 'Self as mere witness' is seen as absorbing all other thoughts.  
But the end is not yet reached. The idea of duality, such as 'I am the witness' \('I' and the 'witness'\), is still persisting. It is only at the last stage when the knower alone ever _is,_ and besides which nothing else exists, that the culmination is reached. This realisation of the _non-dual_ is the consummation of Aparokshanubhuti.  
It is needless to say that Aparokshanubhuti may here mean also the work that deals with it.

This book is prescribed for gaining Liberation from the matter equipments and their delusory play. I am ever liberated already, only at present my personality has been sunk within the matter equipment and from this identification I have to liberate myself. Liberation is from the physical body and its limitations and hunger and thirst. At present I am limited by my emotional demands and intellectually I am throttled by the intellect’s perversions and its own lack of discrimination. My intellectual ideas, my emotional feelings and my physical appetites control me at present. I want to withdraw myself from these and learn to master my body, my passions, emotions and my intellectually distorted ideas. 

Till now I have been living in the physical equipment, in the plant and the animal kingdoms, catering to the physical demands. After rising intellectually and emotionally to the human plane, I have achieved to that extent more but that is not the highest. 

I still have to transcend the very intellect and go into the state of pure Consciousness. In order to help us to transcend to the supermanhood this book is prescribed. To gain freedom in myself and then to use the body, mind and intellect as a vehicle in the outer world to achieve something intellectually in the world is called Liberation. This is the last stage in evolution. Aparokṣānubhūti is a science textbook, not in the sense of an idea, secular science but a spiritual science. We say that a secular science is mastered when the concepts are mastered. But in a spiritual science, it is not enough that the ideas are transferred to the grey matter in the intellect. In the spiritual sciences, we have to first intellectuaIly understand the concepts, apprehend them and then experience them ourselves, within ourselves. Just as a prescription given by a physician alone will not cure a patient, unless patient takes the prescription, presents it to a chemist, gets the medicine, and then consumes it. Only then will the disease be cured and normal health restored. Similarly, this science being the science of the spiritual development has to be understood, assimilated, absorbed and experienced in order to reap its full benefit. 

For all scientific study, certain qualities are required of the students in order to ensure their success. In this verse, Śrī Śaṅkarācārya indicates the qualification for a spiritual student, when he says ‘santaḥ’ - the ‘good people’. Śaṅkarācārya means those who are burning with an aspiration to live a life of nobler values .and chastened ideals. They are those who are not satisfied by merely living in sensuality but who want to gain in life the maximum, demanding the greatest achievement. Only they are the ones who can put forth the necessary effort to master this most subtle science. This is not an easy path. It requires great efforts on the part of the seeker. Those who are not intellectually subtle, who refuse to question life, cannot progress on their path.
