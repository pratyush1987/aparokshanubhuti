### Commentaries

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Swami Vimuktananda" %}
Herein is expounded \(the means of attaining to\) Aparokshanubhuti$$^1$$ \(Self-realisation\) for the acquisition of final liberation. Only the pure in heart should constantly and with all effort meditate upon the truth herein taught.

$$^1$$_Aparokshanubhuti_ -- It is the direct cognition of the Atman which is always present in all thought.  
Everybody has some knowledge of this Atman or Self, for, to deny the Self is to deny one's own existence. But at first its real nature is not known. Later on, when the mind becomes purer through Upasana and Tapas, the veil of ignorance is gradually withdrawn and the Self begins to reveal its real nature. A higher knowledge follows at an advaned stage, when the knowledge of the 'Self as mere witness' is seen as absorbing all other thoughts.  
But the end is not yet reached. The idea of duality, such as 'I am the witness' \('I' and the 'witness'\), is still persisting. It is only at the last stage when the knower alone ever _is,_ and besides which nothing else exists, that the culmination is reached. This realisation of the _non-dual_ is the consummation of Aparokshanubhuti.   
It is needless to say that Aparokshanubhuti may here mean also the work that deals with it.
